**Revised_BSW Algorithm - Verilog Implementation**

This repo is the prototype for the hardware implementation of Revised_BSW Algorithm.

The SW.v and tb.v are revised from 110-2 ICD final project.

Ten testcases are provided, including the comparison between SW / BSW / Revised_BSW.

```$ ncverilog tb.v SW.v +define+tbx```


The Python implementation can be found in:
