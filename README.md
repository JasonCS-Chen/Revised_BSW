# Revised Banded Smith-Waterman Algorithm

This repo is the Software (Python) and Hardware (Verilog) implementations of the Revised BSW Algorithm.

The algorithm changes the band according to the left and right sums of the scores.

This work is for the 111-1 Special Project, and is based on the 110-2 ICD final project.

Advisor: Prof. Yi-Chang Lu, National Taiwan University
